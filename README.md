Certainly! Below is a detailed tutorial for setting up the backup files, which you can include in your README.md file in your GitHub repository. This guide covers cloning the repository, setting up rclone, configuring the backup script, and scheduling the backup process.

Quilibrium Backup Setup
Introduction
This repository contains a script and configuration files to automate the backup of files to Storj using rclone. Follow these steps to set up and run the backup process on your machine.

Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:

A GitHub account
A Storj account with an access grant and a configured bucket
rclone installed on your machine
Basic familiarity with using the terminal
Step-by-Step Setup Guide
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine to get the backup scripts and configuration files.

Open your terminal.

Run the following command to clone the repository:



```git clone https://github.com/augustov58/quilibriumBackup.git```

Navigate to the cloned directory:


`cd quilibriumBackup`

2. Install and Configure rclone
Install rclone:

If rclone is not already installed, you can install it using the following commands:

On Debian/Ubuntu:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y rclone
On macOS (using Homebrew):

bash
Copy code
brew install rclone
For other operating systems, follow the installation instructions on rclone's official website.

Configure rclone:

Use the provided template to configure rclone for Storj.

Copy the template configuration file:

bash
Copy code
cp rclone.conf.template ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
Edit the configuration file to add your Storj access grant and bucket name:

bash
Copy code
nano ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
Replace the placeholders YOUR_ACCESS_GRANT and YOUR_BUCKET_NAME with your actual Storj credentials. Save and exit the editor.

3. Set Up the Backup Script
Make the script executable:

Make sure the backup_to_storj.sh script has executable permissions:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x backup_to_storj.sh
Run the script:

Execute the script to configure your backup:

bash
Copy code
./backup_to_storj.sh
The script will prompt you to enter the following information:

The full path of the directory you want to back up (e.g., /home/user/documents)
The destination path on Storj (e.g., storj:bucket/path)
The time for daily backup in HH:MM format (24-hour clock, e.g., 02:00 for 2:00 AM)
The script will save these configurations and set up a cron job to run the backup daily at the specified time.

4. Verify the Cron Job
Check that the cron job is set up correctly:

bash
Copy code
crontab -l
You should see an entry similar to the following:

bash
Copy code
00 02 * * * /path/to/your/backup_to_storj.sh
This indicates that the script will run daily at 2:00 AM. Adjust the time according to the input you provided.

5. Testing and Troubleshooting
Test the backup:

Run the backup script manually to test it:

bash
Copy code
./backup_to_storj.sh
Check the destination on Storj to ensure the files are copied correctly.

Check the log file:

The script logs backup activities to a log file (~/backup.log). Review this file to troubleshoot any issues:

bash
Copy code
cat ~/backup.log
6. Updating the Script
If you need to update the script or configuration:

Make the necessary changes to the files.

Add and commit your changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Update backup script"
Push the changes to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
Additional Information
Security: Ensure your credentials and access tokens are handled securely. Do not hard-code sensitive information in your scripts or configuration files.
Cron Job Management: Use crontab -e to edit cron jobs if you need to change the schedule or parameters.
Repository Maintenance: Regularly update your repository to include any changes or improvements to the backup process.
Conclusion
By following this guide, you should have successfully set up an automated backup process to Storj using rclone. Your files will now be securely backed up on a daily basis, ensuring that your data is protected and easily recoverable.

For any further assistance or issues, please refer to the rclone documentation or contact the repository maintainer.
